## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox properly.

### Continued development

I'm planning to take other challenges and learn from others.

### Useful resources

- [Josh Comeau - CSS Reset](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js/treasure-trove/010-global-styles) - This helped me for better CSS reset but I remove the other rules that are not needed. I really liked this css reset and will use it going forward.
